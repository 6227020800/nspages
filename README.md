I'm looking for a co-maintainer!

If you're a user of this plugin, don't worry: I'm still taking care of it, I will make sure it keeps working with future versions of Dokuwiki. But I have much less time than before to dedicate to it, and as a consequence feature requests tend to pile up.

If you're interested in co-maintaining this plugin, just send me an email (adress available in the commit log).
